Hi! I'm Henry, a nonbinary trans man and a special collections librarian. As collections librarian and assistant professor in the [Marian Library](https://udayton.edu/marianlibrary) at the University of Dayton, on traditional Myaamia and Shawnee lands, I steward rare and circulating published materials from 1473 to the present, with central responsibilities in collection development, collection management, preservation, instruction, and reference as well as scholarship and service.

I am also currently serving as co-chair of the Special Collections and Archives Interest Group in the Academic Library Association of Ohio and on the Scholarships committee of the Rare Book and Manuscript Section of the Assocation of College and Research Libraries. You can find out more about 

Research
======
My research interests include critical special collections librarianship, Christianity (especially Catholicism) and the history of the book, and intersections of the two. At the present, I am working on addressing harm and hate in special collections and the role of the Catholic Church in the history of libraries, including the Marian Library. You can find my [publications](https://henryhandley.github.io/publications/) and [presentations](https://henryhandley.github.io/presentations/) on the corresponding pages on this website, with a more comprehensive view from my [CV]. I also occasionally publish short posts on the [Marian Library's blog](https://udayton.edu/blogs/marianlibrary/) highlighting the library's collections, like [manuscript fragments in rare book bindings](https://udayton.edu/blogs/marianlibrary/2020-07-28-recycling-book-history-manuscript.php), [emblem books](https://udayton.edu/blogs/marianlibrary/2020-09-29-puzzling-pictures.php), a relative of the [Biden inauguration Bible](https://udayton.edu/blogs/marianlibrary/2021-01-25-biden-bible-rings-a-bell.php), and more.
