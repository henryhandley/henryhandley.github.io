 As collections librarian and assistant professor in the [Marian Library](https://udayton.edu/marianlibrary) at the University of Dayton, I steward rare and circulating published materials from 1473 to the present, with central responsibilities in collection development, collection management, preservation, reference, and instruction, as well as scholarship and service.>


 Research
======
<My research interests include critical special collections librarianship, the history of the book, and intersections of the two. At the present, I am working on addressing harm and hate in special collections and the role of the Catholic Church in the history of libraries, including the Marian Library. You can find my [publications](https://henryhandley.github.io/publications/) and [presentations](https://henryhandley.github.io/presentations/) on the corresponding pages on this website, with a more comprehensive view from my [CV]. I also occasionally publish short posts on the [Marian Library's blog](https://udayton.edu/blogs/marianlibrary/) highlighting the library's collections, like [manuscript fragments in rare book bindings](https://udayton.edu/blogs/marianlibrary/2020-07-28-recycling-book-history-manuscript.php), [emblem books](https://udayton.edu/blogs/marianlibrary/2020-09-29-puzzling-pictures.php), and more.>
